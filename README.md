# SEO Checker V2 - Enhanced UX Edition

A complete redesign of the SEO Checker with improved user experience, tree structure navigation, and advanced features.

## 🎉 What's New in V2

### Core UX Improvements

- **Hide Done Items** - Toggle to hide reviewed/completed items (Ctrl+H)
- **Enhanced Filtering** - Combine multiple filters (search, status, review status)
- **Dark Mode** - Eye-friendly dark theme with toggle (Ctrl+D)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Power user shortcuts for common actions

### Quick Wins Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cd "SEO checker app v2"

### Access the App

## 📊 Data Storage

V2 uses a separate data directory to avoid conflicts:

```
SEO checker app v2/
├── data-v2/
│   ├── scan-results-*.json  (scan results per sitemap)
├── saved-sitemaps.json      (bookmarked sitemaps)
└── url-reviews.json         (review status data)
```

You can run V1 and V2 side-by-side safely!

## 🔄 Migrating from V1

V1 and V2 can coexist. If you want to import V1 data:

1. Copy `data/` contents to `data-v2/`
2. Copy `url-reviews.json` to V2 directory
3. Load saved results in V2

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

```bash
# Check if port 3838 is in use
lsof -i :3838

# Kill process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Restart
pm2 restart seo-checker-v2
```

### No results showing

1. Ensure you've run a scan first
2. Check filters aren't too restrictive
3. Try "Load Saved Results" button
4. Check browser console for errors

### Dark mode not persisting

Dark mode preference is saved in localStorage. Clear your browser cache if issues persist.
