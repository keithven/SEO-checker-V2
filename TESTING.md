## üêõ Known Limitations (Frontend UI Not Built Yet)

These features work on the backend but don't have UI yet:

- ‚ùå No "Generate AI Suggestions" button on URLs yet
- ‚ùå No modal to view AI suggestions
- ‚ùå No bulk AI rewrite interface
- ‚ùå No AI cost tracker display
- ‚ùå No keyword extraction UI

**Coming Next**: I'll build the frontend UI for AI features so you can use them visually!

## üí° What to Look For

### Good Signs ‚úÖ
- Dark mode works smoothly
- Filters combine correctly
- Tree view shows site structure
- Hide done actually hides items
- Copy buttons work
- Keyboard shortcuts respond
- Duplicate detection is accurate
- Histogram shows meaningful data

### Issues to Report üêõ
- Any UI glitches or layout issues
- Filters not working together
- Tree view not showing correctly
- Hide done not hiding items
- Dark mode not persisting
- Keyboard shortcuts not working
- Server errors or crashes

## üìä Compare to V1

**What V2 Adds:**
- Tree structure navigation (V1 doesn't have this)
- Hide done toggle (V1 doesn't have this)
- Enhanced filtering (V1 has basic filters)
- Duplicate detection button (V1 doesn't have this)
- Character histogram (V1 doesn't have this)
- Dark mode (V1 doesn't have this)
- Keyboard shortcuts (V1 doesn't have this)
- AI backend ready (V1 doesn't have this)

## üéØ Priority Tests

If you're short on time, test these first:

1. **Basic Scan** - Does it work end-to-end?
2. **Tree View** - Does the structure make sense?
3. **Hide Done** - Does it actually hide reviewed items?
4. **Dark Mode** - Does it look good and persist?
5. **Duplicate Detection** - Does it find duplicates accurately?

## üöÄ Next Steps

After you've tested, let me know:
- What works well?
- What's broken or confusing?
- What would you like me to prioritize next?

Then I'll build the AI frontend UI so you can:
- Click a button to get AI suggestions
- See 5 options in a nice modal
- Copy or replace meta descriptions
- Do bulk AI rewrites
- Track your AI costs
